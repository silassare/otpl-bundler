# otpl-bundler
bundle otpl templates for web

## Why Otpl-bundler
when using otpl-js in a browser you may have error like:
> XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///path/to/template.otpl
> Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes:
> http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource
so we bundle all our template files in a single file and load it as js file
